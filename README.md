To run, type:
ruby init.rb


Requirements:
* ruby 1.9 (tested on 1.9.2)

** libopenal-dev
** libpango1.0-dev
** libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
** libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
** libsndfile-dev
** libxinerama-dev

* short command to install libs on debian-based OS: (sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev libfreeimage-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libpango1.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsndfile-dev libxinerama-dev)
